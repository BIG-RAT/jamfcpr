Copy packages from a directory (local/mounted share/drive) or from one JCDS to another JCDS/directory/share with the jamfCPR app.  Shares can include local distribution points.  Note, shares must be mounted in advance of replicating.  The application is scriptable, see the Wiki for more.

Verify connectivity if no packages have been uploaded.

Packages can be sorted by name, size, or status.  The status column makes it easy to see what packages need updating.
<br><br>

Once you have a list of packages from the source server select the package(s) you wish to replicate and click the Replicate button.  For the first two methods packages are replicated from the source JCDS/directory/share to the destination JCDS/directory/share.  For the last method, where a JCDS is the source, packages are downloaded to ~/Downloads/jamfcpr/, then uploaded to the destination JCDS.  By default, once the upload is complete the local copy is deleted.  This behavior can be changed by selecting Save from the Options button.  In addition you're able to select Save Only, i.e. packages will only be downloaded.
Checksums are used to determine if the package to upload differs from what is already on the JCDS. 

* To override this behavior, and force package(s) to sync, select "Force Sync" under the Options button.

Note, percents shown represent percent of current file being uploaded/downloaded.  The status bars below the downloading/uploading text fields represent the progress of all transfers.  

* It can take several minutes for packages to show as available (Jamf Pro syncs with the JCDS once an hour), please be patient waiting for the 'refresh' button to disappear.  The logs can be checked to verify the upload, should see something similar to:

```
    20210512_050017 loaded file to data.
    20210512_050017 Perform upload task
    20210512_050023 	 file successfully uploaded.
    20210512_050023 Upload: security.pkg
    20210512_050023 Status: READY
```

Application log is available in ~/Library/Logs/jamfcpr/.  You can quickly access the logs folder from the menu bar, View --> Show Logs or âŒ˜-L.
